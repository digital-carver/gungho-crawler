gungho-crawler
==============

A Web crawling suite of modules for Perl - "Yet Another High Performance Web Crawler Framework"

Note: This is a **copy** of the original repo at https://code.google.com/p/gungho-crawler/, I just svn2git'ed it for convenience. 
This looks to be the most sophisticated Web crawling solution on CPAN (https://metacpan.org/module/Gungho) today, and I wish to hack on it a bit, learn its ins and outs, maybe even contribute, hence this repo. 

All credits to the original authors for the great work they've done on this.
